# Important Note Regarding Project Proposa

I currently have two project ideas for this term project, with a preference for "Hearthstone (Arena) Analysis". However, I will make my final decision after receiving feedback. I prefer "Hearthstone (Arena) Analysis" since the dataset seems unique, and the other topic seems boring.

1. Engaging Social Media Content & Resting Heart Rate
2. Hearthstone (Arena) Analysis

## Engaging Social Media Content & Resting Heart Rate

### Motivation

Since this project has an interesting limitation on datasets, I focused on the available data sources rather than focusing on ideas for a proposal. My mobile phone and smartwatch are among the most frequently used items that collect my data. Therefore, I concentrated on the applications I use most often: Apple Health and Instagram.

The motivation behind this project is to determine whether the engaging social media content I consume has any physiological effects on me. By analyzing timestamps of my social media interactions and periods when I am not engaged in physical activities, I aim to explore my body's reaction to consuming engaging social media content.

### Data Sources

* Requested personal data from [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com).
* Requested personal health data from [Apple](https://www.apple.com/health/).

## Hearthstone Arena Game Mode Analysis (Prefered)

### Motivation

Since this project has an interesting limitation on datasets, I focused on available data sources that I thought were less common than social media and health data: Hearthstone Arena game mode data.

The motivation behind this project is to determine optimal deck-building strategies. By analyzing the structure of the decks I have built over time, I aim to identify the strategies I should pursue more frequently and those I might consider avoiding in the future.

### Data Sources

* [Hearth Arena](https://www.heartharena.com) - a website that tracks and stores your Hearthstone matches.
